In this post, I'm just trying to type some random text to see if the excerpt length will stop when I reach 180 characters. I also want to see how it looks like when the post is rendered on the frontend.

## Decision

I thought that 180 chars are maybe too much for an excerpt but after seeing the output on the post's card in the blog, I now think that I'll keep it the way it is.
