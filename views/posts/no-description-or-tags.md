This post is for testing the output of an article that doesn't have a description or even a tag. Everything seems to be okay since the display of the tags and their respective numbers are not affected by the absence of tags in a post on the [Tags](/tags) route.

## Note

I've completely removed the `description` and the `tags` from the front matter of the Markdown file of this post. It was also possible to just leave them empty, the result would exactly be the same.
